                I don't like the looks of this. Terrax said <span class="character-name">Galactus</span> was weak, but he's
                holding his own against Thor and <br/><span class="bump10">Iron Man together!</span>

            <span id="bubble3" class="bubbles">
                I ain't so sure of that Torchie. Is it my <br/><span class="bump10">imagination <strong>&#8230;</strong></span>

            <span id="bubble5" class="bubbles">
                It's not imagination, Ben. <span class="character-name">Galactus</span> is using his energy reserves faster
                than his body can replenish them. He's actually dwindling <br/><span class="bump10">in size.</span>

            <span id="bubble6" class="bubbles">
                But I fear his power may still prove too much. He may yet emerge the victor in <br/><span class="bump10">this conflict.</span>
