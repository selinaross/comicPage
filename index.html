                I don't like the looks of this. Terrax said <strong>Galactus</strong> was weak, but he's
                holding his own against Thor and Iron Man together!
            </span>
            <span id="bubble3" class="bubbles">
                I ain't so sure of that Torchie. Is it my <br/><span class="bump10">imagination <strong>&#8230;</strong></span>
            </span>
            <span id="bubble4" class="bubbles">
                <strong>&#8230;</strong> or does <strong>Galactus</strong> look <strong>&#8230;</strong> smaller?
            </span>
            <span id="bubble5" class="bubbles">
                It's not imagination, Ben. <strong>Galactus</strong> is using his energy reserves faster
                than his body can replenish them. He's actually dwindling in size.

            <span id="bubble6" class="bubbles">
                But I fear his power may still prove too much. He may yet emerge the victor in this conflict.
            </span>
            <span id="bubble7" class="bubbles">
                Perhaps not, my friend.

                Who <strong>&#8230;</strong> ? <strong>Doctor Strange!</strong>

            <span id="bubble9" class="bubbles">
                At your service once more, if service I may be!
            </span>
            <span id="bubble10" class="bubbles">
               But surely even your powers are of no use against the likes of <strong>Galactus</strong> ?
            </span>
            <span id="bubble11" class="bubbles">
                The mage's cloak of levitation billows as doctor strange set-tles to earth.

                Not directly, perhaps. My powers over matters physical are limited.

                Still, there are things a master of the mystic arts may do which transcend mere force.

                And around <strong>Galactus</strong>, the fury of battle grows still.
